## 🫁 Lung Cancer Detection using CNN & Transfer Learning

A deep learning-based project to classify lung CT scans into Normal, Benign, or Malignant using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning (ResNet50 & Xception). 

### 🚀 Key Features

🧠 CNN Models: Custom CNN architectures for lung nodule classification.

⚖️ Data Balancing: Implemented SMOTE and class weighting to handle dataset imbalance.

📊 Transfer Learning: Used ResNet50 and Xception pre-trained models for better accuracy.

🩻 Medical Dataset: Trained on IQ-OTH/NCCD Lung Cancer Dataset (1190 CT scans).

📈 High Accuracy: Achieved up to 97.4% accuracy with balanced CNN models.

🛡 Validation: Reduced false negatives for malignant nodules, improving clinical reliability.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- Languages: Python 

- Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras

- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, OpenCV

- Techniques: CNNs, Transfer Learning (ResNet50, Xception), SMOTE, Class Weighting

- Dataset: IQ-OTH/NCCD (CT scans of 110 patients)


### 📊 Results

- CNN (no balancing) → 77.7% accuracy

- CNN + SMOTE → 97.4% accuracy ✅

- CNN + Class Weights → 95.1% accuracy

- Transfer Learning (ResNet50, Xception) → High precision, robust classification
